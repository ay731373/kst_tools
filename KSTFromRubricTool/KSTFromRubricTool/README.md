# KSTFromRubricTool

software tool for constructing knowledge space from expertsâ€™ estimation of cognitive complexity.

## Description

The tool takes one file that represents the estimation of cognitive complexity for test items. The file should be in CSV format and each row in the file should represent one problem and its estimated cognitive complexity. 

If item number 7 had cognitive complexity rated with 1 and item number 4 had cognitive complexity 3, the file should look like the exmaple given below:

```
7, 1
4, 3
```
